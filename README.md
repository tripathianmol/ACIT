# ACIT: A Course in Truth
This text is the corrected version of ACIM (A Course in Miracles - Foundation for Inner Peace), which erroneously and malevolently presents a reflection of reality and truth.

The Christian worldview presented in ACIM is one where death is worshipped, guilt for committing sin is discouraged, and selfish action is encouraged.
