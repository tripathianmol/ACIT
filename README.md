# ACIT: A Course in Truth

This text is the corrected version of ACIM (A Course in Miracles - Foundation for Inner Peace), which erroneously and malevolently presents a reflection of reality and truth.

The Christian worldview detailed in ACIM is one where death is worshipped, guilt for committing sin is discouraged, and selfish action is encouraged.

### Tips for contributing

Lead the reader to face the future, which is eternal life. ACIM maliciously causes death by misleading the reader to face the past, which does not exist and is gone.

In correcting ACIM:

- Change past tense to future tense, and keep the present tense unchanged (TBD).
- Change "Christ" to "Krishna."
